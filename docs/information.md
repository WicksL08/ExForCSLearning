# Information About the CTF Study

## Study Overview

This study focuses on exploring the effectiveness of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges as an experiential learning tool to improve cybersecurity education at the high school level. By using CTFs, we aim to engage students in real-world scenarios that test their understanding of networking, security, and problem-solving skills.

## Study Methodology

The study will involve a series of hands-on CTF challenges designed to teach students key concepts in cybersecurity. The CTF activities will cover topics such as:

- Networking basics (IP addresses, routing, etc.)
- Web security (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Cryptography (encryption and decryption)
- System vulnerabilities and exploits

Through this study, we will collect both qualitative and quantitative data to assess the impact of CTF challenges on student learning outcomes.

### Goals of the Study

The key goals of the CTF study are as follows:
1. **Evaluate the Effectiveness of CTFs**: We aim to measure how well CTF challenges help students understand cybersecurity concepts and improve their problem-solving abilities.
2. **Increase Engagement**: By using interactive CTF challenges, we hope to increase student engagement and interest in pursuing careers in cybersecurity.
3. **Provide Insights for Educators**: The study will provide valuable feedback to educators on how CTFs can be integrated into the high school cybersecurity curriculum.

## Why Use CTF for Cybersecurity Education?

CTF challenges provide an engaging and hands-on approach to learning. Unlike traditional lectures or textbook-based learning, CTFs allow students to actively apply their knowledge in realistic, simulated environments. By solving challenges, students can gain practical experience and build critical thinking skills that are essential for success in the cybersecurity field.
