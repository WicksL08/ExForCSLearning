# Welcome to the CTF Study

Welcome to the Capture The Flag (CTF) Study page! This study explores the use of CTF challenges as an experiential learning tool to improve high school cybersecurity education. Our goal is to enhance the practical knowledge of students and prepare them for real-world cybersecurity challenges.

Throughout this platform, you will find various CTF activities that help students learn fundamental networking and cybersecurity concepts in an engaging and hands-on way. Join us in exploring how CTFs can bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application in cybersecurity.

## Why Capture The Flag (CTF)?

Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges are a fun and interactive way to learn and test cybersecurity skills. They allow students to apply what theyâ€™ve learned in a real-world scenario, making it easier to understand complex topics like networking, cryptography, and system vulnerabilities. By participating in CTF activities, students will develop problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of the practical applications of cybersecurity concepts.

## Goals of the Study

This study aims to:
1. Investigate the effectiveness of CTF challenges as a learning tool.
2. Explore how CTFs help students apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
3. Analyze how hands-on CTF experiences enhance cybersecurity education at the high school level.
