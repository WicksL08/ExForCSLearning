Ex4CSLearning – Pilot Study Website

This repository hosts the official Ex4CSLearning Pilot Website, developed as part of a cyber security education research project at The University of Alabama.  

It provides an interactive, student-friendly interface that supports three Capture the Flag (CTF)–style learning modules: OSINT, Password Cracking, and Cryptography.

The website is published through GitHub Pages and connects to learning material , CTFd (for challenges) and (for pre/post assessments and surveys).

Purpose

The goal of this site is to:
